#### Set up the application on Heroku  
* Create an app on Heroku on the free tier with this application setup. Use the free Heroku add-ons as necessary.  
* Seed the database.  
* Set up logging with any of the free services you like and add permissions to that service for mrich@dosomething.org and mholford@dosomething.org  
* Make sure Redis is backing the queue and session drivers  
* Share the application with mrich@dosomething.org and mholford@dosomething.org  

#### Bonus:
