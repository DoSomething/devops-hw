# DoSomething.org DevOps Homework

## Instructions

    Set up the application on Heroku
      - Seed the database
      - Set up logging with any of the free services you like and add permissions to that service for mrich@dosomething.org and mholford@dosomething.org
      - Make sure Redis is backing the queue and session drivers
      - Share the application with mrich@dosomething.org and mholford@dosomething.org

    Bonus: Set up the Laravel queue in the Procfile. Don't worry about making sure things are actually sending via the queue.

    Question: Are there any things you would have liked to have had more time to do to improve the setup of this app?
